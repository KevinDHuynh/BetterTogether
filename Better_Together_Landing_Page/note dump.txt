TODO: 

major:



minor:
fix semantics for h6 paddding on cover
fix alignment of  navbar button text and other anchor tag elements: the alingment is off because  the anchor tag does not proppely lake in line hight thus not centering it in 


micro:
fix line height on the  a tags in the nav bar;  it ignores the line-height, would be nice to have for consistnecy but does not inerupt typography because they are single elements 


Notes: 
 work around to get propper nav bar alingment is to ignore the line height property for the buttons: we can do this without affecting the vertical rhythm becasue they vertically stand alone: to compensate for how it affect the size of the button we can add extra padding for the same effect

Take Aways: borders matter when going for perfect spacing
